# OceanParcels quantitative experiments

This folder holds Jupyter notebooks developed by Alan Fox, from originals provided for a workshop held at GEOMAR (Jan 2020), for experiments in getting quantitative information on ocean transport routes and overflows from particle tracking with Ocean Parcels and Viking20x.

The main idea is that each particle is assigned a volume transport which it maintains throughout its life. By sourcing particles on vertical sections in the ocean across significant straits we can estimate the sources and destinations by volume.

This adds information to the more traditional Eulerian measurement of volume transports across ocean sections, allowing for significant 3-dimensionality and time variability in the flow.Experiments with ocean parcels, viking20x and quantifying transports
